# OpenGL Dino Game 

This is my Computer Graphics Project inspired by the _Dino game_ on Google Chrome,
written in **C** on **OpenGL API** using `freeglut` library.

## Commands

### Install Dependencies

This program is written in **C**. So the `gcc` compiler is required to compile it. In addition, it
uses the `freeglut` library for the **OpenGL API**.

Install `gcc` and `freeglut` on `ubuntu`/`debian` using:

```bash
sudo apt install gcc freeglut3-dev
```

### Compile Program

Visit `./src` folder using:

```bash
cd src
```

Compile program using:

```bash
gcc game.c -lGL -lGLU -lglut
```

### Run Game

Run the game using:

```bash
./a.out
```
